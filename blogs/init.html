    <p>So what becomes of us when we release pity, allowing it to converge into remanence or drift out of the body, leaving behind the thoughts that haunt us in parallel with our motives, creating a symbiont that desecrates the mind in the process of building? A cynical attempt, a practical judgment, the passive look where everything is achieved through artificiality, yet the faces show no insolence and the materials lie dried and spent. Is it an act of respect in tandem, or an antagonistic deceit, to portray our decadence as the byproduct of machinery rather than the vocality of our own surrender to desire? In truth-telling, do we collaborate with that cynicism and create a version of ourselves that both locates desire and repels it? Are the buildings surrounding us telling us to remember our role, that we are actors on a stage constructed by the grasp of depravity? It sure sounds like the world is spinning but if we can build away from it, maybe the noise stopping will allow us to hear ourselves again.<p>
