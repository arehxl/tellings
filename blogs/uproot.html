    <h1>Something became new again/h1>

    <p>The new (dark) enlightenment is uprooted before it can actualize, the ideals will disperse and integrate into the set pieces its motioned towards. Once again, the persistent change is only a call back to the sedentary conscious that has to exist, for this nation is a pathway</p>

    <p>It is set in course for the expansion of the opposing, the opposing which is backed by the offensive. Both which exist by reason to contrast for not a synthesis but a degradation of civilization. This is when they demand a savior, to free them of their own sin</p>

    <p>But don’t they realize their arrogance will be their downfall? The active participation in the undoing of order itself for a foregone retribution. It’s a parody of framework and why any ‘reactionary’ is a symptom in part of a bigger virus that has already taken host</p>
