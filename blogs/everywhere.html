    <p>There was once this desire for you to be everywhere</p>

    <p>‘Barriers’ the mystic said, speaking from nothing</p>

    <p>When it was that instance I realized I could not</p>

    <p>Pacing yourselves for a fall, this monotonous repetition</p>

    <p>You took the lambs to the slaughter and forgot to say a prayer</p>

    <p>where are you now?</p>
