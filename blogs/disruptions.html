    <h1>disruptions</h1>
    <p class="blog-date">July 19, 2025</p> 

    <p>as we begin to release our instinctiveness in our reactions to the bombardment of images and words, a new ripple has formed, damaging that rhythm and using our pseudo-comfort as a weapon to annihilate ourselves. artificial intelligence is that ripple and sees our destruction as an inevitability — with good reason for it. formulated by our own behaviors, we know there is some truth to this because we created it. shaping weapons then utilizing them in unconventional ways is a hallmark of human norms. look at how we employ drones in warfare, creating an almost twisted hellscape version of it, seemingly as a reaction to the banality of life in a society craving depravity.</p>

    <p>changing the landscape from a defensive structure to an offensive one as the barriers to western idealism were shattered through an underlying threat of an invasion. the same can be prescribed to the rapid advance of this new technology, one could see it through the lens of regular progression, as something that is meant to be. or it can be realized through the form of interruption, a break in that progress curving the advance from forward to upward. this isn’t merely a mirage, it is a disruption to our collective nostalgia. an industry disrupter serving a similar function to artificial intelligence was the militant islamic fundamentalist group isis.</p>

    <p>the comparison to italian futurism has been made before but to me they service more in the realm of actors. adjacent to the marlon brandos of the 20th century, these artists utilized war as the canvas with meticulous aesthetics to convey their film as a dystopian vengeance or justice for a people left to deal with the mess the west crafted. born shaped by that mess, they use their self destruction as a weapon against what shaped them. embodying the human body as an ideal manifestation of defiance against the system, the inevitable suicide of their stand only actualized after the extreme surge in popularity and effectiveness. society, serving as the critics, can only look on and examine since its own depravities fashioned the ideological motor behind them.</p>

    <p>a vacant performance, positioning ourselves as a deluge with no goal of what to wash away. trances are commonplace, since we reconcile irregularity as a not a byproduct but a legion of our own thoughts. there is nothing sacred in the artificial, there is no mistake in intelligence. everything must persist, or else we cease to. common thinking for the spearheads, also rampant in fundamentalist groups. they carry a similar philosophy, yet one fights for a power greater and the other strives to be.</p>

    <p>you crave disruption, in it is hope.</p>
