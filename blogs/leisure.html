    <h1>The water is closer</h1>
    <p class="blog-date">October 23, 2025</p> 

<p>I forgot to prioritize the leisure or the less of what I became</p>
<p>In through my becoming, I saw that change is approaching</p>
<p>A false synecdoche, the whole is not what was once shame</p>
<p>It’s name is anew and my heart is encroaching onto the same</p>
<p>I don’t believe there is change</p>
<p>I see that from then is just now in course</p>
<p>A course is fixed</p>
<p>Everything on the plain</p>
<p>The analog is coating, nothing else is eclipsed</p>
<p>So when the time runs out, there is no one else to blame</p>
<p>Land over the water, fall, water is falling onto the surface</p>
<p>Approach from the other side, it’s purpose, no it’s what we deserve</p>
<p>So much to say, the thinkers and theorists can perform</p>
<p>It’s only a superficial gathering, they’re really in the nation adorned</p>
<p>With the jewels of your change, now you’ve become like them</p>
<p>There’s no becoming, you were taken in vain</p>
