    <h1>that which lingers underneath</h1>

    <p>there exists no method to the idea. what becomes of art becomes itself. in times past, there existed a pressure of nonconformity, the urge to reach into a state unknown. the praxis of axioms.</p>

    <p>the era in which the aesthetic has actualized and converged into malleable steel, which can reinforce its target as the metaphysical coat of arms it desires to be. since the fight against the mundane has become the martyr for the architect to idolize, its presence lingers beneath that realism which capitalizes on our willingness. plastered on the walls of the spec house are the milestones of this new society, the one that let itself consume the aspects it needed to destroy.</p>

    <p>the economization or the withering, the Futurism stuck in a loop. the buildings have already collapsed; the corpses remain standing. positioning change as inevitability, the process becomes mechanized into an act rather than its ontology.</p>

    <p>we noticed that need and deliberated against it; it is in these times that counting becomes the motion for silence in this proto-sensibility nature, drowning in those cravings of reverence at the reminder of mortality.</p>
